1. Data structure choices for each component (Menu, Customer Order, Order Confirmation, Open Orders Queue, Completed Orders), and justifications for your choices. Your justifications should include complexity analysis and trade-offs.

Menu	            A fixed list of 5 Bistro drinks
- Array as the list will be fixed and an array is an easy way to store it
- Bag if not fixed (ie, changed every day or depending on availability)

Customer Order	    Contains customer name and list of ordered drinks
- Linked list for easy insertion to handle the dynamic nature of conversation

Order Confirmation	Allows repeating the order back to the customer
- Linked list as it allows me to go through (print) each item efficienty one after another

Open Orders Queue   Queue of submitted orders waiting to be marked complete
- CircularQueue as the first-in, first-out system will be efficient for handling complete orders

Completed Orders	Records all completed orders for end-of-day report
- Deque as it allows for efficient addition at the front via append, and removal at the end via pop
- but in my program, i ended up using an array and instance varaibles as that was simplest for me to understand

4. Any known bugs or limitations.
Whenever 3 or 4 is done, I end up with weird "[<CustomerOrder.CustomerOrder object at 0x00000244B56097F0>, <CustomerOrder.CustomerOrder object at 0x00000244B56099A0>]" being outputted alongside the desired output. The program works fine, but I never found a way to get rid of this weird printed statement.

Also, the end of day report is a little asymmetrical as I wasn't able to figure out how to make it symmetrical, but it still is functional.

5. What you‚Äôd add next if you had more time.
- A more visually-appealing interface for the operator / customer
- More usage of datastructures I wasn't able to implement due to lack of knowledge on how to apply them (program still works but I could've used more applications of other datastructures)
- Maybe an option to edit or remove current orders entirely, in case customers request it
