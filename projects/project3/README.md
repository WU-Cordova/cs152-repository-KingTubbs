1. Data structure choices for each component (Menu, Customer Order, Order Confirmation, Open Orders Queue, Completed Orders), and justifications for your choices. Your justifications should include complexity analysis and trade-offs.

Menu	            A fixed list of 5 Bistro drinks
- Array as the list will be fixed and an array is an easy way to store it
- Bag if not fixed (ie, changed every day or depending on availability)

Customer Order	    Contains customer name and list of ordered drinks
- Linked list for easy insertion to handle the dynamic nature of conversation

Order Confirmation	Allows repeating the order back to the customer
- ListStack as last-in, first-out allows for customer to easily recall their orders (they need to backtrack less)

Open Orders Queue   Queue of submitted orders waiting to be marked complete
- CircularQueue as the first-in, first-out system will be efficient for handling complete orders

Completed Orders	Records all completed orders for end-of-day report
- Deque as it allows for efficient addition at the front via append, and removal at the end via pop
